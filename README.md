# Neural Machine Translation Evaluation &amp; Error Analysis in a Spanish-Korean Translation

This repository is to share human evaluation data of the Spanish-to-Korean translation. This dataset is manually built and collected from professional translators, serving as valuable resources for my Ph.D thesis at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. You can find the full text at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347510033_Neural_Machine_Translation_Evaluation_Error_Analysis_in_a_Spanish-Korean_Translation).

### Abstract
Not long ago, the field of Machine Translation experienced a conceptual turn from Rule-based to Statistical. At this moment, we are undergoing a technological turn with Neural Networks. While they are claimed to be a new state-of-the-art, this thesis attempts to clarify the performance of open source NMT models includ- ing Google Translate, in the Spanish and Korean languages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to test this language pair.

We conduct a binary evaluation of i) Direct Assessment of Fluency and Adequacy and ii) a comparison of translation from scratch and Post-editing. We report that it has obtained 78% of performance in Fluency and Adequacy. Fur- thermore, Post-editing its translation is 37% more productive than translating a text from scratch. As additional work, our error analysis demonstrates that 94% of the errors are on a lexical level while 6% are for a syntactic reason. We argue that such a finding is significant in linguistically distant pairs such as ours. We, thus, suggest a promising future of NMT.
