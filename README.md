# Neural Machine Translation Evaluation &amp; Error Analysis in a Spanish-Korean Translation

Ph.D Thsis at Universitat Pompeu Fabra

## Abstract
Not long ago, the field of Machine Translation experienced a conceptual turn from Rule-based to Statistical. At this moment, we are undergoing a technological turn with Neural Networks. While they are claimed to be a new state-of-the-art, this thesis attempts to clarify the performance of open source NMT models includ- ing Google Translate, in the Spanish and Korean languages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to test this language pair.

We conduct a binary evaluation of i) Direct Assessment of Fluency and Adequacy and ii) a comparison of translation from scratch and Post-editing. We report that it has obtained 78% of performance in Fluency and Adequacy. Fur- thermore, Post-editing its translation is 37% more productive than translating a text from scratch. As additional work, our error analysis demonstrates that 94% of the errors are on a lexical level while 6% are for a syntactic reason. We argue that such a finding is significant in linguistically distant pairs such as ours. We, thus, suggest a promising future of NMT.
